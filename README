OVERVIEW
--------
tone-generator (tonegend) generates telephony-related tones, and plays them via PulseAudio. In particular, it creates tones as defined in IETF RFC 4733 "RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals".

tone-generator provides a D-Bus API to clients on the system bus.

tone-generator is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1.

BUILDING
-------
This package should be properly 'debianized' soon. (Note that there is an old Debian packaging, for the Maemo operating system, at https://gitorious.org/maemo-multimedia/tone-generator/commit/cb6cf3bfdd70e409a18b4fd9f3684371105d360f ).

Until then:
# install dependencies
apt-get install automake libtool pkg-config libdbus-glib-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libpulse-dev
# compile
./autogen.sh
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
make
make install

RUNNING
-------
tone-generator runs as a daemon in a user session. An Upstart init script is provided (debian/tone-generator.conf).

The --volume-dtmf parameter defines the default volume of generated DTMF sounds, as a percentage of the maximum volume.

Changing the -b (buffer length in milliseconds) and -r (minimum request time in milliseconds) parameters is a tradeoff between responsiveness and memory consumption.

EXAMPLE USAGE
-------------
# Play a DTMF tone corresponding to key '5'
dbus-send --system --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=com.Nokia.Telephony.Tones /com/Nokia/Telephony/Tones com.Nokia.Telephony.Tones.StartEventTone uint32:5 int32:0 uint32:0
sleep 3
dbus-send --system --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=com.Nokia.Telephony.Tones /com/Nokia/Telephony/Tones com.Nokia.Telephony.Tones.StopTone

# Play a signalling tone corresponding to 'network congestion' for three seconds
dbus-send  --system --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=com.Nokia.Telephony.Tones /com/Nokia/Telephony/Tones com.Nokia.Telephony.Tones.StartEventTone uint32:73 int32:20 uint32:3000

HISTORY
-------
tone-generator was written by Nokia, and it is used in devices based on the Maemo and MeeGo operating systems, see https://gitorious.org/maemo-multimedia/tone-generator .
Maintenance of tone-generator was picked up by the Nemo Mobile project, and it is used in devices based on the Sailfish operating system, see https://github.com/nemomobile/tone-generator .
